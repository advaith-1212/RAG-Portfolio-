# Advaith's Profile

## Bio
Full name – Venkata Satyasri Advaith Hanumanchi. B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialisation Blockchain Tech at SRM IST (3.8 CGPA) → Current M.Eng. Computer Science with a focus in AI/ML, Cornell University - Cornell Tech (2025-26) with a merit scholarship. IELTS Academic 8.0 (C1). Combines blockchain R&D, ML Ops, and product strategy; focuses on privacy-preserving DeFi, agentic-AI evaluation pipelines, and RAG-powered personal knowledge agents. Has a depp interest in finance, trading, and using AI in these areas. Always exploring the intersection of blockchain and AI. 

## Projects

Sigmantic - AI Theorem Prover; • The project investigates whether machine learning models can learn to predict the next proof
tactic given a Lean goal state. If successful, such models could reduce proof-authoring time, enable semi-automated reasoning, and contribute toward long-term goals in AI-assisted mathematics. The experiments followed LeanDojo’s Mathlib4 benchmark setup.
Baseline Performance: Train base model on goal–tactic pairs. Report prediction accuracy and proof completion rates. Transformer Comparison: Train a transformer model on the same dataset, Compare to quantify improvements in accuracy and proof coverage.
Proof Completion: Evaluate whether models can autonomously finish entire proofs by chaining predicted tactics.
Error Analysis: Examine where models fail (e.g., inductive proofs, tactic mispredictions, or long context reliance).
Ablations: Restrict tactic vocabularies or limit proof depth to understand model sensitivity.

CarbonChain – FHE-secured decentralized carbon-credit trading foyer; designed escrow vault, tokenization flows, sprint docs; patent in progress.

WagerDM - Betting via DMs; Using chat interfaces to place bets in prediction markets such as Polymarket. 

DeTrade – Ethereum P2P payments protocol with 2×/× collateral model; led smart-contract design and UI.

Agent-as-a-Judge Benchmark Pipeline – OCR→QA extraction→multi-LLM inference→Grafana analytics for six coding agents; >60 % manual effort saved (conversation history).

iOS Lane & Pothole Detector – Converted YOLOv8-ONNX to CoreML (Vision-compatible) for real-time mobile inference (conversation history).

Delivery-Agent Aggregator – Flask-based chatbot linking local couriers in India (Zepto, Zomato, Blinkit, Ola/Uber) to micro-delivery requests (conversation history).

RAG Portfolio Chatbot – Chroma/pgvector + Gemini Flash 2.0 pipeline to answer visitor queries on my work.
